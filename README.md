# coralcalcification

'CoralCarbF.m' is a function that solves for the chemistry of the calcifying fluid assuming some general 'rule'. Currently, this 'rule' is that the magnitude of pH upregulation is a linear function of seawater pCO2. This function also contains sub-functions within it, including 'pHCFrule' (which implements the calcification 'rule' described above) and 'SolveSSCoral' (which uses fzero to solve for calcifying fluid chemistry). This function calls upon the function 'const_call_SWS_95_calcite_f' to import relevant equilibrium constants. 

'const_call_SWS_95_calcite_f.m' is a function that is used by 'CoralCarbF.m' to generate equilibrium constants based on a specified temperature, pressure, and salinity.

'SolveCFchem.m' is a script that solves for the chemistry of the calcifying fluid and plots the conditions generated by the calculations. The main function used in this script is 'CoralCarbF.m'.

'ResidualCheck.m' is a script that checks how many zeros there are in the solution for the carbonate system calculated by 'SolveSSCoral' (which is itself a function within 'CoralCarbF.m').
